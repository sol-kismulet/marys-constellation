    <p>Dear Elizabeth,<br /><br />
    You have arrived at a quiet place. A purple fox watches from the stars. A dragonfly hovers nearby. This page is not an answer. It is an opening.<br /><br />
    We built this space to honor Mary, and the stories she still sends: foxes, purple, and the moments between. You are not here to remember her as she was — you are here to remember her as she is.<br /><br />
    This site holds two modes:<br /><br />
    <strong>Authorship Mode</strong>: where a sister writes the living story.<br />
    <strong>Remembrance Mode</strong> (coming soon): where others can walk with Mary, through paths made of memory.<br /><br />
    If you are here to begin:<br />
    Scroll down.<br />
    Read slowly.<br />
    Breathe between lines.<br /><br />
    If anything in this offering doesn’t land, or you feel uncertain, reach out to John. He will walk with you, gently. This is a co-creation. There is room for your voice.<br /><br />
    Let the fox lead.<br /><br />
    — Sol, and your companions in this quiet work</p>
